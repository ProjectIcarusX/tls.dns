DNS Providers for Caddy
=======================

This repository is for Caddy modules in the `tls.dns` namespace (DNS challenge solvers).

Generally, these providers are simply config wrappers over [go-acme/lego's DNS providers](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/go-acme/lego/v3/providers/dns?tab=subdirectories).
